# Question_Game
Simple 3 Question Game
This game was created to practice what I have learned with the python module Kivy.

This game uses the "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" template as its background.

There are 3 questions. When you select the correct answer, the user will receive a popup with a button to goto the next question. If they select the wrong answer, there will be a popup prompting the user to try again. To close the popups, the user must click outside of the popup. The user must click the "Next question" button after they answer the question correctly or they will not goto the next question. After completing the game, there is a final screen that will congratulate the user on completing the game.
